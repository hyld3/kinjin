# Kinjin

This is a personalized fork of the Mokujin bot. Some less important features has been stripped and misc. functionality has been added.

## If you want to use this:

Clone this to a linux server that has Python 3.6.0+ and install the dependencies with:
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
You need your own discord bot ([instructions](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)) and have the tokens in the `src/resources/config.json`. You can add a feedback channel there also.


The executable is `src/mokujin.py`.

```
